## User manual for the app
A land owner goes onto our website and immediately they are welcomed by the layers that are available.
They are then prompted to choose a lawyer of their own choice.
On choosing a lawyer they are provided with the information of that particular lawyer.
And then on that note they can then press the call now on  the lawyer page if they wish.
they are then taken to the page were they can schedule a call by inputing their details,(email, name, phone number and password of their choosing)
On doing that they can then access the call page where they input a user name and join the call.


## Call access
in order to be able to make the video call accessible we used Agora to generate a token that runs for a day and a half and when it expires we cant accesss the call so in order to enable the call a new token may be generated.
